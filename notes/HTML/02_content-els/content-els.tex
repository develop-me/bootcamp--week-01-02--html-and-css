\begin{infobox}{Lorem Ipsum}
    \textbf{Lorem Ipsum} is latin. We use blocks of latin text as \textit{placeholders} when we are building websites, before real content is added. It's a good language as it doesn't mean much to us, but is still representative of how westernised languages would appear in blocks \& sentences.
    To get \textbf{Lorem Ipsum} you can type \textit{Lorem} followed by enter into vscode, or find a \href{https://www.lipsum.com/}{generator online here}.
