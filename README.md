# Develop Me HTML & CSS Syllabus

HTML &amp; CSS Syllabus for Developme: This covers both the first two weeks of the fellowship and the part time evening course.

### Overview

The first part is mainly based on theory lessons, learning HTML & CSS. Syntax, elements, style & layout, with supported exercises.

The second part is writing the templates for a multipage site. Theory includes how to approach a project, design handover, CSS methodology to structure your HTML & CSS well; we support the theory of component design and reuseable CSS

There are three categories taught in this course: HTML, CSS & Web Theory. The latter is for notes & lessons on accessiblity, preformance, testing, project planning & design theory.

### Folder structure

- exercises
	Each lesson contains exercises, here you will either find the code or the instructions for the students
- notes
	These are the students notes - see []() to run LaTeX to generate the pdfs for the students
- quiz
	There is one for each week/part, but they are held in google docs - see the notes in the readme for where & how to distribute
- slides
	These are also the tutors notes. We encourage live coding over slides, however all these notes use [PITCHME](https://github.com/gitpitch/in-60-seconds) markdown files, so you can view as plain markdown, or run on github as a presentation (good for new tutors).

### Notes for new tutors

Go through the repo - the slides folder especially. We teach in increments so you may feel valuable info is being ommited only to find it's being taught at a later stage. Don't overwhelm your students - remember you will have to lie until you can tell the truth.

## Suggested Course Structure

Feel free to mix and match the syllabus order as you see fit. This is proposed so you can keep track of where you have been and where you go next.

Order in the repo is as per category, not as per order in which you teach.
